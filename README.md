# Models-From-Scratch  

## Overview  
**Models-From-Scratch** is a collection of machine learning models implemented from the ground up in **Python, C, and C++/CUDA**. This project serves as an exploration of machine learning fundamentals while emphasizing **good software engineering practices, testing, and efficient implementation** across multiple languages. My goal is to step one layer of abstraction below libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, so that I gain insight into the backends of these frameworks.

By coding these models from scratch, this project aims to:  
- Gain deeper insights into the mathematical foundations of machine learning.  
- Explore the efficiency trade-offs between Python, C, and CUDA implementations.  
- Implement and benchmark optimized machine learning models, including GPU-accelerated versions.  
- Provide a structured, well-tested, and easy-to-use library with FastAPI integration.  

## Implemented Models  
This repository contains (or will contain) implementations of the following models:  

### Classical Models

#### Supervised Learning
- **[Linear Regression](src/classical/linear_regression/README.md)**
- **[Logistic Regression](src/classical/logistic_regression/README.md)**
- **[K-Nearest Neighbors](src/classical/k_nearest_neighbors/README.md)**
- **[Naive Bayes](src/classical/naive_bayes/README.md)**
- **[Decision Tree](src/classical/decision_tree/README.md)**
- **[Random Forest](src/classical/random_forest/README.md)**
- **[Support Vector Machine](src/classical/support_vector_machine/README.md)**

#### Unsupervised Learning
- **[K-Means Clustering](src/classical/k_means/README.md)**
- **[Principal Component Analysis](src/classical/principal_component_analysis/README.md)**

### Deep Learning Models
- **[Feedforward Neural Networks](src/neural/feed_forward/README.md)**
- **[Convolutional Neural Networks](src/neural/convolutional/README.md)**
- **[Graph Neural Networks](src/neural/graph/README.md)**
- **[Recurrent Neural Networks](src/neural/recurrent/README.md)**
- **[Long Short-Term Memory](src/neural/lstm/README.md)**
- **[Transformers](src/neural/transformer/README.md)**

(*Future additions may include generative models.*)  

Each model has its own folder, containing implementations in **Python, C, and CUDA**, along with a dedicated README explaining the approach and optimizations.  

## Installation  
This project is designed to be packaged as a Python module with C/CUDA extensions. A full API will be available via **FastAPI** with containerized deployment using **Docker and Kubernetes**.  

### Dependencies  
- Python: `numpy`, `sklearn`, `torch` (for benchmarking)  
- C/C++: `gcc`, `g++`, `CMake`  
- CUDA (if using GPU-accelerated models): `CUDA Toolkit`, `nvcc` 

Installation instructions will be available once packaging is finalized.  

## Benchmarks  
Each model includes:  
- **Speed benchmarks** comparing Python, C, and CUDA implementations.  
- **Memory usage analysis** to assess efficiency.
